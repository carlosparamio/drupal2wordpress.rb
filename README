Quick'n'dirty Ruby script to migrate Drupal blog posts to WordPress, written initially for Drupal 4.7.11.

*** WARNING*** 
Still not tested after first refactor, it could be broken. If you want to run it, do it at your own risk, and make databases backups first.
*** WARNING*** 

TODO

- General refactor
- Ask user each interesting required value instead of hardcode it
- Import Drupal blog nodes only
- Count number of posts on each category
- Use DataMapper to avoid ActiveRecord default behavior at some points
- Separate worksize in tinier blocks instead of load all at memory
- Add useful output
